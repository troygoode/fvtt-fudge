# Foundry VTT: Fudge

Fudge your dice rolls! Adds a new dice roll tool to the tokens toolbar. Click the 💩 button, enter in a dice roll formula (like `1d20+3+2`), enter in your desired result (like `< 10`), and voilà! Your dice have been secretly rolled a bunch of times in the background ensuring only your desired result is shown to the players.
